# Roby
I was looking for a library to program computer for action repeatation same as RoboTask Application.
I Found some codes, but they were so heavy and of course so hard to install.
So, I decided to program it in a very simple way.

# Requirments
```
pip install pyautogui
```

# How we can work with that?
Just run the Record.py file. Choose a filename for your config and program it, In each part, Program would tell a breif of selected action.
Also you can write a file with .task extention and write in program template manually.

## Mouse Point vs Move Mouse
the Mouse Point would move the mouse to specific position of screen, if you put a delay after this command it would move softer. 
Also we have the same thing in Move Mouse, it would be move mouse based on the current position.

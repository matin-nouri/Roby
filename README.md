# Roby
There's a very simple application to record your daily actions and do it whenever you want.
This IDEA Provided by RoboTask Program. And also, a library which called pynput released for record the mouse and keyboard actions and run them by pyautogui library.
The thing is For using RoboTask, Payments are required. And also the codes with mentioned library was a bit heavy and hard to understand. We provided a new thing that you write the commands in terminal and see how it works.

# Requirments
```
pip install pyautogui
```

# How we can work with that?
Just run the Record.py file. Choose a filename for your config and program it, In each part, Program would tell a breif of selected action.
Also you can write a file with '.task' extention and write in program template manually.

## Mouse Point vs Move Mouse
the Mouse Point would move the mouse to specific position of screen, if you put a delay after this command it would move softer. 
Also we have the same thing in Move Mouse, it would be move mouse based on the current position.
